# E-commerce-Marketing-Insights

## Introduction
In the dynamic world of business, answering key questions is essential for driving growth and strategy. This project leverages the [Kaggle E-commerce Marketing Insights](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikumarrajvansh/marketing-insights-for-e-commerce-company) datasets to explore common business challenges and trends. The analysis will cover crucial areas such as revenue and retention trends, cohort behavior, the impact of discounts on pricing, and customer segmentation. Additionally, more advanced techniques—including lifetime value (LTV) forecasting, cross-selling analysis, and predicting the next purchase date—will be employed to provide deeper insights into customer behavior and business performance.
